I want to make the national information infrastructure 5* as defined by Tim Berners-Lee system.

I want to take the national information infrastructure through the [Open Data Institute](http://www.theodi.org) [Open Data Certificate](https://certificates.theodi.org/).

I started with the [NII CSV](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/national-information-infrastructure) which can be found on data.gov.uk(http://www.data.gov.uk) and a copy of which is here.
